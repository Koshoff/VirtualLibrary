# VirtualLibrary

This is my first project, a virtual library. It has several features.
Admin login, user login, adding a book as an admin, renting a book as a user, 
user registration, and checking if a book exists in the catalog.
I am using three classes, one for the user, one for the book, and one for the methods.
